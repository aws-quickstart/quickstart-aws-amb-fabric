The Partner Solution sets up a highly available Managed Blockchain architecture with a single initial member, Member A, that spans two Availability Zones (in the diagram, the areas that are shaded yellow). Members B and C are included in the diagram to emphasize that a typical blockchain consists of several members, although this Partner Solution creates only the first one. The other members must be invited using either the AWS Management Console or AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).
